    'body' => '<h3>Hello!</h3>
        <p>My name is Ben Tobias and I am the creator or nossairmandade.com.  I\'m a software engineer, a kambo practitioner, a dad, and a few other things besides.  I live in Seattle, WA, USA, where I am part of a Daime church called CÃ©u de Seattle.</p>
        <p>
            When I started taking Daime in the fall of 2009, there were no online resources to speak of for new people to study the hymns or the doctrine of the Daime.
            I took it on myself to make something, a place where people could find recordings and text for the hymns so they could practice even if they
            didn\'t have a book or a recording of their own.  At that time these things were hard to come by!
        </p>
        <p>
            Needless to say, having been in the Daime for three months, I didn\'t know much.  I made lots of mistakes and lots of assumptions that turned out
            to be incorrect.  Over the years I\'ve received lots of feedback - mostly friendly - pointing me in a more right direction.  And as you may know, the Daime
            is a tree with many branches and it\'s very difficult to represent them all in the same place.  As much as I may wish to do so, the site is not perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you find something incorrect on the site, please don\'t hesitate to reach out to me.  While I can\'t always fix things right away - this site is an act
            of service for me and competes with all of the other necessities in my life - I will do my best.  I love to hear from you about your experiences with the site.
            And I really want this to be a collaboration.  What makes the Santo Daime great is every one of us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks so much for being here.  Viva the Santo Daime!
        </p>
