                As you can see, I\'ve made a few changes.

            <p>
                It\'s been 10 years since I first set up nossairmandade.com.  In that time I\'ve learned a whole lot about the
                Daime that I didn\'t know when I started.  I\'ve also learned a lot about making websites.  I\'ve been wanting to
                overhaul the site for a long time but never quite got to it.  Well, I\'ve had some extra time on my hands lately
                and so I went ahead and did it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know change can be hard, especially with websites we\'re familiar with and rely on.  I\'m sorry.  I promise that just about
                everything is still here.  I just cleaned the code, moved things around a little, and set myself on a much easier
                path to updating the site in the future.  Please take your time, explore the new site, and let me  know if I made
                any mistakes.  I hope to hear from you.
